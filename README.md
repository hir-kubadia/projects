## Self-Projects Created by me...

This particular branch or sub-repo called "Misc-Projects" consists of all the projects that I have created in pursuit of learning new stuff or practice the things learnt in college...

### 1. Online Retail Dataset EDA (Python)

This is the my first ever python project I used all the libraries and packages I've learnt from the beginning put together in a single project. What an experience! Now I feel a little experienced in python. Apart from that, I was successful in bringing out immense information from the dataset. First one successful one!!

### 2. Online Retail Dataset Visualisation (Power BI)

Again used Power BI for the first time, and it's actually simple just drag and drop. Build beautiful dashboards and got nice insights from the visuals. Again, what a great experience learning new skills!!
