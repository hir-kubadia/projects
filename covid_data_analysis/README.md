## Self-Projects Created by me...

This particular branch or sub-repo called "Misc-Projects" consists of all the projects that I have created in pursuit of learning new stuff or practice the things learnt in college...

### 1. Online Retail Dataset EDA (Python)

This is the my first ever python project I used all the libraries and packages I've learnt from the beginning put together in a single project. What an experience! Now I feel a little experienced in python. Apart from that, I was successful in bringing out immense information from the dataset. First one successful one!!

### 2. Online Retail Dataset Visualisation (Power BI)

Used Power BI for the first time, and it's actually simple just drag and drop. Build beautiful dashboards and got nice insights from the visuals. Again, what a great experience learning new skills!!

### 3. Covid Data Analysis (SQL | Power BI)

Exclusive project to showcase my SQL skills. One of the largest projects uptill now. Involved import huge datsets in RDBMS which is slightly difficult task. Wrote some really complex queries to find out interesting data about the pandemic around the world. And finally created beautiful real-time updating dashboards in Power BI. Learned a lot!!!

### 3. Telangana Tourism Analytics (Python) [WORK IN PROGRESS]

Collected data from telangana state torusim website of domestic and foreign toursits over the span of 4 years. I managed to find the CAGR of increase or decrease in the number of toursists from 2016-2019. Found the 'Population to toursit footfall ratio' of each district. Found interesting insights, helped a lot to hone my skills.
