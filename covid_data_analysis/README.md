## Covid Data Analysis Using SQL and Power BI

In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of global Covid-19 data using SQL and Power BI. The primary objective was to derive meaningful insights and visualize trends related to the pandemic. The project involved the following key tasks:

### Data Collection and Transformation: 
Imported and transformed raw Covid-19 datasets using Power Query Editor in Power BI to ensure data quality and consistency.

### SQL Analysis: 
Utilized SQL to write complex queries and perform thorough data analysis, answering critical questions such as:
- Identifying the country with the highest number of recorded cases.
- Calculating the death rate as a percentage of total cases.
- Determining the country with the highest infection rate.
- Analyzing worldwide death rates per day.
- Calculating the percentage of vaccinated population for each country.
- Computing the rolling total (cumulative) of vaccinations each day.
And several additional queries to explore various aspects of the data.

### Visualization: 
Created dynamic and insightful visualizations using Power BI to present the analyzed data in an easily interpretable and visually appealing format. The visualizations included bar charts, line graphs, maps, and custom visuals to highlight key findings and trends.

This project showcased my proficiency in SQL for data analysis, my ability to transform and clean data using Power Query Editor, and my skill in creating impactful visualizations with Power BI. It provided valuable insights into the Covid-19 pandemic, which could help inform public health decisions and strategies.
